  # As a custom resource, it behaves like a native kubernetes object.
  # This means that users can perform CRUD operations through the
  # Kubernetes API or kubectl. In addition, it means that the user

spec:
  # The user can specify servers to use when running tests. The
  # initial version only supports 1 server to limit scope. Servers
  # is an array for future expansion.
  #
  # There are many designs and systems to pursue load balancing,
  # organizing and monitoring a mesh of servers. Therefore, this
  # will likely be expanded in the future.

  # timeoutSeconds is an integer field that indicates the longest time a test
  # is allowed to run, in seconds. Tests that run longer than the given value
  # will be marked as Errored and will no longer be allocated resources to run.
  # For example: timeoutSeconds: 900 indicates the timeout of this test
  # is 15min. The minimum valid value for this field is 1.
  timeoutSeconds: 900

  # ttlSeconds is an integer field that indicates how long a test is allowed to
  # live on the cluster, in seconds. Tests that live longer than the given value
  # will be deleted. For example: ttlSeconds: 86400 indicates the time-to-live
  # of this test is 24h. The minimum valid value for this field is 1.
