metadata:
  # Every load test instance must be assigned a unique name on the
  # cluster. There are ways we can circumvent naming clashes, such
  # as using namespaces or dynamically assigning names.

  # As a custom resource, it behaves like a native kubernetes object.
  # This means that users can perform CRUD operations through the
  # Kubernetes API or kubectl. In addition, it means that the user
  # can set any metadata on it.
  labels:

spec:
  # The user can specify servers to use when running tests. The
  # initial version only supports 1 server to limit scope. Servers
  # is an array for future expansion.
  #
  # There are many designs and systems to pursue load balancing,
  # organizing and monitoring a mesh of servers. Therefore, this
  # will likely be expanded in the future.
  servers:
  - language: node
    clone:
      repo: https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node.git
      gitRef: master
    build:
      command: [ "bash", "/build_scripts/build_qps_worker.sh" ]
    run:
      command: [ "node" ]
      args: [ "-r", "./test/fixtures/native_native.js", "test/performance/worker.js", "--benchmark_impl=grpc" ]

  # Users can specify multiple clients. They are bound by the
  # number of nodes.
  clients:
  - language: node
    clone:
      repo: https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node.git
      gitRef: master
    build:
      command: ["bash", "/build_scripts/build_qps_worker.sh"]

  # We can optionally specify where to place the results. The
  # controller will attempt to mount a service account in the driver.
  # This can be used for uploading results to GCS or BigQuery.
  # results:
  #   bigQueryTable: "example-project.foo.demo_dataset"

  # timeoutSeconds is an integer field that indicates the longest time a test
  # is allowed to run, in seconds. Tests that run longer than the given value
  # will be marked as Errored and will no longer be allocated resources to run.
  # For example: timeoutSeconds: 900 indicates the timeout of this test
  # is 15min. The minimum valid value for this field is 1.
  timeoutSeconds: 900

  # ttlSeconds is an integer field that indicates how long a test is allowed to
  # live on the cluster, in seconds. Tests that live longer than the given value
  # will be deleted. For example: ttlSeconds: 86400 indicates the time-to-live
  # of this test is 24h. The minimum valid value for this field is 1.
  ttlSeconds: 86400

  # ScenariosJSON is string with the contents of a Scenarios message, formatted
